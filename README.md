Stream Monitor

We have a stream in our backyard which support huge salmon runs decades ago. Today, one or two fish are spotted each year but they die before they are able to spawn. My goal is to reintroduce salmon into our stream. But first, I need to understand the current health of the stream.

The project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller (the SparkFun Thing) and waterproof temperature sensors to collect air and water temp. The data is then sent to Microsoft Azure. I made use of one of Azure's preconfigured solutions - Remote Monitoring - to process and display the data in a dashboard.
